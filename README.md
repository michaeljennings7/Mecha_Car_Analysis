# Mecha Car Analysis

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to use R to run statistical analysis on cars to determine fuel efficiency of prototypes from a fictional company called MechaCar.

## MPG Linear Regression
Below is the output of the MPG file linear regression:

* We can see from the screenshot above that the non-random variance variables when it comes to MPG were vehicle_length and ground_clearance. This seems to make sense as other factors such as weight and spoiler angle 

* The slope is most like not zero because the null-hypothesis can be rejected. Meaning, the p-value is much smaller than 0.005
